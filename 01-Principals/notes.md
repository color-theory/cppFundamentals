# 1. Principals of Programming and Software Engineering

## 1.1 Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Design

* Coding without a solution design increases debugging time.
* Software engineering facilitates development of programs.

**Software engineering** facilitates development of programs.

## An Examination of Problem Solving

* A solution specifies a system of interacting objects.
* An object is an instance of a class.

**Problem solving** refers to the entire process of taking the statement of a problem
and developing a computer program that solves that problem.

**Solution**-A computer program consisting of a system of interacting classes of objects.

**Object**-Has a set of characteristics and behaviors related to the _solution_.

**Class**-A set of objects having the same type.

## Aspects of an Object-Oriented Solution

* Modules implement algorithms, which often manipulate data.

**Modules**-Self-contained units of C++ code. Can be a function, method, class,
several functions or classes, or other blocks of code.

**Algorithm**-a step-by-step recipe for performing a task within a finite period of time.

## Abstraction and Information Hiding

* Specify what to do, not how to do it.
* Write specifications for each module before implementing it.
* Specifications do not indicate how to implement a module.
* Specify what a module does, not how it does it.
* Specify what you will do to data, not how to do it.
* An ADT is not a fancy name for a data structure.
* Develop Algorithms and ADTs in tandem.
* All modules and ADTs should hide something.

**Abstraction**-Separates the purpose of a module from its implementation.

**Functional (or Procedural) Abstraction**- Separating the purpose of a module from
its implementation.

**Data Abstraction**-focuses on what data operations do, not implementation.

**Abstract Data Type(ADT)**-A collection of data _and_ a set of operations on data.

**Data Structure**-How you will implement the ADT. A construct that you define in a
programming language to store a collection of data.

**Information Hiding**-A Principal that says to hide certain details from public,
and make them closed for modification.

## Principals of Object-Oriented Programming

* Objects encapsulate attributes or data and behaviors or operations.
* Encapsulation hides inner details
* Inheritance supports reusing software
* Polymorphism allows an object's behavior to be determined at runtime
* An overloaded operator has multiple meanings

**Encapsulation**-Objects combine data and operations
**Inheritance**-Classes can inherit properties from other classes.
**Polymorphism**-Objects can determine appropriate operations at execution time.

## Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

* Analysis explores a problem, not a solution
* Object-oriented analysis explores a problem in terms of its objects
* Design explores a solution to a problem
* object oriented design explores a solution's objects and their collaborations.

**Requirements**- What a solution must be and do.

**Object-oriented Analysis(OOA)**-Understanding of the problems and requirements of a
solution and expressing them in terms of the objects within world objects, software
systems, or ideas. Describe the problem.

**Object-oriented Design(OOD)**-Describing a solution in terms of software objects
and how those objects will collaborate with one another to fulfill the requirements
of the problem.

**Collaborate**-When objects send messages to one another...call each other's operations.
